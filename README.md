# Salvis Bank

## Project of a webpage & app for fictional bank

_Design based on [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) page_

**This project was created as a summary of the technologies I have learned and was created based on:**

- HTML5
- CSS3 + SASS
- JavaScript + **TypeScript**
- Supabase (an alternative to Firebase)
- PostgreSQL

During development, I was heavily inspired by the look of Revolut's website, which I think looks simple, clear and modernistic. However, I wrote all the animations, layouts and RWD myself.

### ROADMAP

[x] Create overall layout and plan
[x] Create landing page
[ ] Create app page (banking functionality)
[ ] Connect to a Supabase
[ ] Create sign-up functionality
[ ] Create banking functionality
